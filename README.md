# Darkroom CV
> **An End-to-End, Model-Agnostic Computer Vision Framework**

## Overview
**Darkroom CV** is a comprehensive computer vision framework designed to manage the entire Machine Learning lifecycle—from dataset annotation and model training to multi-source inference and hardware profiling. 

Built as a robust experimentation sandbox, it aims to solve the fragmentation of CV workflows by unifying them into a single, purely local, and scalable environment.

## Why I Built This

Working with computer vision day to day, I kept running into the same recurring friction:

* Cloud upload limits and slow dataset uploads
* OS compatibility issues across tools
* Free annotation tools without AI-assisted labeling
* Fragmented workflows spread across multiple platforms

I was spending more energy managing tools than actually developing models. So I built my own framework to unify the entire pipeline — annotation, training, inference, profiling, and deployment — running 100% locally.

## Architecture & Design Philosophy
This project was built with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and practical utility:

* **Model-Agnostic Core:** The framework's core relies on abstractions and lists, decoupling the logic from specific architectures. This allows seamless integration of new models, enabling side-by-side performance comparisons and A/B testing.

* **Full ML Lifecycle Ownership:** By handling annotation (with Active Learning), training, and deployment (inference), it eliminates the need to jump between disjointed tools, demonstrating a complete understanding of MLOps pipelines.

* **Local-First & Unrestricted:** Developed to bypass the limitations of cloud-based proprietary tools (like image caps or OS restrictions), it provides a powerful, uncapped local environment for researchers and engineers.

* **Service Separation: tools** are structured as independent services, reducing coupling and limiting error propagation across modules. The interface is built with OpenCV, but frontend and backend remain separated, so the UI layer can be replaced in the future without touching the system core.

* **Centralized Configuration:** a single config file controls the whole pipeline — enable/disable training, inference, or annotation per model, define architectures and parameters per task, and switch models without modifying the core codebase.

* **Unified CLI:** every mode (live, train, annotate, data processing) runs through one consistent CLI interface, ensuring reproducibility across experiments.

## Core Capabilities

### AI-Assisted Annotation Workflow
A custom-built annotation tool designed to accelerate dataset creation through active learning:
* **Custom AI Assistance:** Seamlessly integrates your custom-trained models (YOLO Seg, YOLO Det, and SETR-PUP) directly into the UI to auto-generate bounding boxes and polygon masks. Train the models in the framework, use them to assist your annotations.
* **Granular Control:** Features a mouse-wheel-sensitive lasso tool for masks, confidence thresholding, multiclass annotation support, and complete undo history (including specific polygon point rollbacks).
* **Flexibility:** Toggle mask/bbox validity, delete-all per frame, and disable UI for streamlined workflows. Includes a built-in Penn-Fudan demo (no AI required) to test the tools out-of-the-box.

### Scalable Training & Multi-Model Inference
* **Stack Execution:** Train multiple AI models sequentially within a single run.
* **Versatile Inference:** Native support for various input streams, including local webcams, video files, and RTSP server feeds.

### Performance Profiling & Hardware Stress Testing
Built-in tools to measure and visualize system impact during inference:
* Automatically logs Cycle Time, RAM, GPU, and CPU usage alongside Active AIs and Captured Objects data.
* Includes a data processing script to generate analytical plots directly from logs.

## Usage & CLI

Currently, the framework is executed via the main python script. System parameters and active models are controlled via `config.yaml`.


```python3 main.py [mode] [-args]```

## modes
### 1. Live
run real-time detection<br>
```
python3 main.py live [-args]
```
<br>

__args:__

- ```-nv``` no video

- ```-cap``` capture objects (process image)

- ```-pl``` create [performance logs ](#Performance-Logs)

- ```-rtsp``` live from video of rtsp server

- ```-sf [frame_number]``` skip frames for better performance

- ```-rec [output_file_name]``` record

### 2. Train:

```
python3 main.py train -p [path_to_config_file]
```

> [!NOTE]

<br>

### 3. Data processing:
Generate plots from logs, separating _capture objects_ from _non capture objects_.<br>
```
python3 data_processing.py
```
Processed logs are saved in the ```logs_processed``` folder
<br>

### 4. Annotation:
run annotation call:<br>
```
python3 main.py annotate -p [path_to_config_file]
```
run demo:<br>
```
